## Verification Checklist

*Use this to verify code matches PRD:*

**For each feature:**
1. Is the feature listed in PRD? (If no, add it or remove code)
2. Does implementation match feature description?
3. Are tests written and passing?
4. Is feature marked complete in milestone?

**For tech stack:**
1. Is code using approved tech stack?
2. Have we documented why if we deviated?

---

## Documentation Principle

**Keep this PRD concise and high signal/noise:**
- Focus on WHAT we're building, not HOW
- Features in one line each
- Guidelines should be actionable constraints
- Update when requirements change, but keep it lean

---

*This PRD is the source of truth. Code must match PRD. Update PRD when requirements change.*
