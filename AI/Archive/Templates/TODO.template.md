## Usage Guide
**Source of Truth:** AI/PRD.md

**Emojis:**
- ✅ = Complete Milestones
- 🔄 = In progress Tasks (mark **bold**, update status/next/files as you work)
- 🚫 = Blocked Tasks (add blocker note)

**Starting a todo:**
1. Mark 🔄, make title **bold**
2. Add **Status:** 📍 [What's done], **Next:** ➡️ [Next step], update **Files:** 📁

**Completing a todo:**
1. Verify tests pass
2. Mark [x], add **Tested:** [results]
3. During /handoff: clean up and move to Completed Milestones
  - Clean up means keeping it minimal: name + hash + test results

**Current Session Context:**
- Update during every /handoff
- Gives next agent immediate orientation
- Replace entire section each time

**Key Rules:**
- High signal/noise: Be concise
- Update status as you work, not after
- Tests must pass before marking complete
